The question was which disease to choose. We ruled out coronavirus as it is easily preventable through vaccines and cannot be prevented by a healthy well-being. We recognised that many diseases represent the health part of the theme however we wanted something the would encapsulate the theme of health and well-being in its entirety.</span><span class="p">Diabetes fits this specification perfectly. Diabetes results in the body not being able to properly manage blood glucose levels meaning people with diabetes have to carefully manage their diet and the amount of exercise they do. Our goal was to accurately represent the struggle to control your blood glucose levels in a fun and engaging manner. The game was<br />built of foundations created by us using resources provided by the godot engine.</span><span class="p">Health bars are a common feature of many games and we aimed to put our own unique spin on an old idea. The result - sugar bar. The goal is to keep your sugar level as<br />balanced as possible, if it gets too high you have failed to properly regulate your condition. If it gets too low you faint from lack of sugar.</span><span class="p">In the UK, more than 4.9 million people have diabetes, With another 13.6 million people now at<br />increased risk of type 2 diabetes due to poor lifestyle choices Research has consistently shown that for some people, combined lifestyle interventions - including diet, physical activity and sustained weight loss - can be effective in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes by about 50%.</span></p>
